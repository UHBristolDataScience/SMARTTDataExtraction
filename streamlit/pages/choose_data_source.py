        **MIMIC-IV Access Information**

        In the future this software will integrate with MIMIC-IV to allow facilitate data extraction from that dataset also. 

        To use the MIMIC-IV dataset, you'll need to follow these steps:

        1. **Apply for Access**: First, apply for access to MIMIC-IV by visiting the MIMIC website and completing the necessary application process.
        2. **Complete Required Training**: Once your access is approved, make sure to complete any required training or certifications.
        3. **Configuration Assistance**: If you already have access or once you've completed the training, contact **chris.mcwilliams@bristol.ac.uk** to configure this application for use with MIMIC-IV.

        Thank you for your interest in MIMIC-IV! ðŸ™Œ
